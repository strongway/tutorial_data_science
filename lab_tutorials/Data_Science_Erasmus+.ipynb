    "## Key principles in Data Science and Behavioral Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science approach to programming, particularly when dealing with data manipulation and analysis, often differs from traditional computer science programming in philosophy, methodology, and tools. The emphasis in data science is on efficiently processing large datasets and achieving clear, concise, and reproducible code, often using **vectorized operations, chaining, and declarative programming paradigms**."

    "### Key principles in data science programming:\n",
    "1. Declarative programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, operations often emphasize \"what\" needs to be done rather than \"how\" to do it. This contrasts with the imperative style in computer science programming, where step-by-step instructions are explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using pandas-like syntax (`df.groupby('group').mean()`) is declarative, the focus is on describing  transformations instead of writing low-level itetrative code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Vectorized operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and R's `dplyr` emphasize vectorized operations. This means that operations are applied to entire arrays or columns of data at once, rather than iterating over each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Chaining in python and piping in R\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaining or piping operations is a concise and expressive way to apply multiple operations sequentially, without creating intermediate variables or repeatedly referencing the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in pandas, you can chain operations like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " result = (df\n",
    "          .groupby('category')\n",
    "          .agg({'value': 'mean'})\n",
    "          .reset_index()\n",
    "          .sort_values(by='value', ascending=False))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and in R, you can use the `tyidyverse` package to pipe operations like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "result = (df\n",
    "          .groupby('category')\n",
    "          .agg({'value': 'mean'})\n",
    "          .reset_index()\n",
    "          .sort_values(by='value', ascending=False))\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is in contrast to using multiple intermediate variables, which can clutter code and increase the likelihood of errors. Additionally, you don't need to worry about the numbers of groups or the size of the data, as the operations are applied to the entire dataset at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Frames as First-Class Citizens\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, the `data.frame` (or equivalent) is often treated as the fundamental data structure, rather than primitive data types like lists or arrays. Operations are expressed in terms of transformations applied to the entire frame or its subsets, enabling parallelization and abstraction.\n"
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "### Why Chaining and Vectorized Operations Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chaining avoids intermediate variables, reducing memory overhead and clutter.\n",
    "- Vectorized operations are often implemented in compiled languages, ensuring faster execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chained operations resemble natural workflows (e.g., filtering, transforming, summarizing), making the code intuitive and easier to review.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explicit loops may struggle with very large datasets, as they are often not optimized for parallel computation. Vectorized operations or chaining mechanisms leverage built-in optimizations for scalability.\n"

    "## Implementing Data Science Principles in Behavioral Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a real example of how these principles can be applied to behavioral data analysis. \n",
    "We will use a recent study on 'distractor volatility and distractor suppression' by Qiu et al. (2024). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Background of this study:__\n",
    "Statistical learning to suppress the location(s) of where a salient distractor is likely (vs. unlikely) to occur can enhance visual search efficiency, an effect termed distractor-location probability cueing. However, whether this effect is influenced by the volatility of distractor occurrence (i.e., of the sequence of distractor-present and -absent events) remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated this question by contrasting two volatility regimens in a distractor-location probability-cueing paradigm: a low-volatility environment ( distractor-present and -absent trials likely streaked) and a high-volatility environment (two trial types changing frequently).\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data and analysis code are hosted in a [github repository](https://github.com/msenselab/statistical_learning_with_volatility). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use the data from this study to demonstrate how to apply data science principles to analyze behavioral data, while ignoring the actual scientific questions and interpretations."

    "## Visualization with Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization in data science, particularly using Seaborn, aligns with the principles of declarative programming, chaining, and vectorization. Seaborn is a Python library built on Matplotlib, designed to make statistical graphics intuitive, efficient, and visually appealing by reducing boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn focuses on what you want to visualize, not how the visualization is constructed. This is achieved by abstracting the complexity of low-level plotting (handled by Matplotlib) and providing high-level, expressive commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Scatter plot\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Declarative: Specify the data and mapping\n",
    "sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='col1', y='col2', hue='category')\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Seaborn Visualization Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are key types of Seaborn plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relational Plots (Relationships between variables)\n",
    "Relational plots explore how variables are related using scatter or line plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.relplot(data=df, x='col1', y='col2', hue='category', style='type')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Categorical Plots (Relationships between numerical and categorical variables)\n",
    "Categorical plots show relationships between numerical and categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.catplot(data=df, x='col1', y='col2', hue='category', kind='box')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distribution Plots (Univariate and bivariate distributions)\n",
    "Distribution plots visualize univariate and bivariate distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.displot(data=df, x='col1', kind='kde')\n",
    "```\n"

    "#### The Chart Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental object in Altair is the Chart, which takes a dataframe as a single argument. \n",
    "Each top-level chart object (i.e. `Chart`, `LayerChart`,\n",
    "and `VConcatChart`, `HConcatChart`, `RepeatChart`,\n",
    "`FacetChart`) accepts a dataset as its first argument.\n",
    "The dataset can be specified in one of three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- as a `Pandas DataFrame <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_\n",
    "- as a `Data` or related object (i.e. `UrlData`, `InlineData`, `NamedData`)\n",
    "- as a url string pointing to a ``json`` or ``csv`` formatted text file\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chart = alt.Chart(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encodings and Marks\n",
    "\n",
    "With this chart object in hand, we can now specify how we would like the\n",
    "data to be visualized. This is done via the ``mark`` attribute of the chart\n",
    "object, which is most conveniently accessed via the ``Chart.mark_*`` methods.\n",
    "For example, we can show the data as a point using `Chart.mark_point`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "alt.Chart(iris).mark_point()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Altair provides a number of mark properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   area: `mark_area()`\n",
    "2.   bar: `mark_bar()`\n",
    "3. line: `mark_line()`\n",
    "4. point: `mark_point()`, `mark_circle()`, `mark_square()`\n",
    "5. text: `mark_text()`\n",
    "\n",
    "`mark_*()` accept a number of parameters. Please see [user guide here for details](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/marks.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encodings\n",
    "\n",
    "Above it draws only one point, because we haven't assign what for `x` and what for `y` etc. This is done by `encode()` method, which builds a key-value mapping between encoding channels (such as `x`,`y`,`color`,`shape`,`size`, etc.) to columns in the dataset, accessed by colmun name. See above example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Altair provides a number of encoding channels that can be useful in different circumstances:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Position Channels__:\n",
    "\n",
    "* x  - The x-axis value\n",
    "* y - The y-axis value\n",
    "* x2 - Second x value for ranges (e.g., error bars)\n",
    "* y2 - second y value for ranges (e.g., error bars for y)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Mark Property Channels__:\n",
    "\n",
    "* color - the color of the mark\n",
    "* fill - the fill color for the mark\n",
    "* opacity - the opacity of the mark\n",
    "* shape - the shape of the mark\n",
    "* size - the size of the mark\n",
    "* stroke - the stroke of the mark\n",
    "\n",
    "__Text and other channels__\n",
    "\n",
    "* text - text to use for the mark\n",
    "* tooktip - the tooltip value\n",
    "* detail - additional property to group by\n",
    "\n",
    "__Facet Channels__\n",
    "\n",
    "* column - The column of a faceted plot\n",
    "* row - the row of a faceted plot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoding data type\n",
    "\n",
    "By default Altair will look the data type and use them correspondently. Alternative, you can specify them explicitly. There are __four__ main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Type  |    Shorthand Code | Description\n",
    "--- | ---- | ----\n",
    "quantitative |  ``Q``   |        a continuous real-valued quantity\n",
    "ordinal      | ``O``    |       a discrete ordered quantity\n",
    "nominal     |  ``N``  |         a discrete unordered category\n",
    "temporal    |  ``T``  |         a time or date value\n",
    "\n",
    "The types can either be expressed in a long-form using the channel encoding classes such as X and Y, or in short-form using the Shorthand Syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "THe shorthand form (e.g., `x = \"name:Q\"`) is useful when doing quick data explorations. The long-form, `alt.X('name', type = 'quantitative')` is useful when doing more fine-tuned adjustments to the encoding, such as binning, axis and scale properties, or more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({'a': list('CCCDDDEEE'),\n",
