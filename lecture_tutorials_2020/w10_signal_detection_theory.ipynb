        "\n",
        "The psychometric function (PF) measures human performance on a psychophysical task (e.g., classification) to a given feature of a physical stimulus (e.g., velocity, duration, brightness, etc.). Recall typical classification response is a binary response, and the sensory input is continuous, so the probability of response is a sigmoid function. A general psychometric function includes the chance level and attentional lapses:\n",

        "$$\\Psi(x,\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\lambda) = \\gamma + (1-\\gamma -\\lambda) F(x, \\alpha, \\beta)$$\n",
        "where $\\alpha$ is the threshold, $\\beta$ the sensitivity, $\\gamma$ the chance level, and $\\lambda$ the lapse rate. Parameters can be estimated by using logistic regression. \n",

        "## High-threshold theory\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's imagine a simple two-interval force-choice (2IFC) task in which observers had to identify which interval contains a target. This kind of 2IFC task can be treated as a signal detection paradigm. Let's denote the interval containing the stimulus as $S$ (signal), and the blank interval as $N$ (noise). The below figure illustrates a probability distribution of two signals. \n",

        "Whether or not the sensory process will detect the sitmulus on any trial is determined by the amount of sensory evidence accumulated by the sensory system. Let's assume that the mean amount of accumulated evidence is a linear function of stimulus intensity $x$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\mu(x)=\\pi + \\rho x$$\n",
        "\n",
        "According to high-threshold theory, the sensory mechanism will detect the stimulus when the amount of sensory evidence exceeds a fixed internal criterion or threshold. As its name implied, high-threshold theory assumes that the internal threshold is high. More specifically, the threshold is assumed to be high enough such that the probability that the threshold is exceedd when $x=0$ (i.e., noise) is effective zero. The decision is based on binary information only: either the sensory evidence was in excess of the threshold, or the sensory evidence was not in excess of the threshold. Given the assumptions we have made, function $F(x)$, which describes the probability that the threshold will be exceeded by a stimulus of intensity $x$, will be the cumulative normal distribution (see the inset in the above Figure). \n",
        "\n",
        "By contrast, there is no such thing as a fixed internal threshold according to SDT. Instead, SDT makes the assumption that sensory mechanism generate a graded signal, corresponding to the degree of sensory evidence accumulated. The decision process has access  to the degree of sensory evidence accumulated on both Signal and Noise. We may think of any presentation of a stimulus as a sample from the probability density function associated with the stimulus. Even in the absence of a stimulus, differing degrees of sensory evidence results, and we may think of the presentation of the noise interval as a sample from the probability density function associated with the noise stimulus. Thus, the decision is based on the relative amplitude of two samples: Signal $N(\\pi + \\rho x), \\sigma^2$, and Noise $N(\\pi, \\sigma^2)$. \n",
        "\n",
        "For 2IFC, one simple decision rule is that if the sample taken during the sitmulus interval has a value greater than the sample taken during the noise interval. That is, if the difference between the sample value derived from the signal interval and the sample value derived from the noise interval exceed zero, the response will be correct. The difference in sensory evidence will be distributed as $N(\\rho x, 2 \\sigma^2)$. "

For such extreme values (i.e., hit rates of 1 and false-alarm rates of 0), A common method for  adjustments is to apply a small correction ([Macmillan & Kaplan, 1985](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4034817); Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999): rates of 0 were replaced by 0.5/n, and rates of 1 by 1–0.5/n, where n is the number of trials, respectively.
